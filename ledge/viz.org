* Losses

** TODO Cumulative losses

** TODO Lag plots
The general purpose equivalent of mm plots.

* Weights

** TODO Weight update plots
The gh heatmap style plots from online-lag-ensemble.

** TODO Weight on loss
Visualizer to show how the weights /accumulate/ losses on the cumulative curves.
Notice that the losses accumulated are given by the rise of the cumulative
segemnt covered.
